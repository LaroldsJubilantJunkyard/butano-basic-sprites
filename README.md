# Drawing sprites on the Game Boy Advance

![Drawing sprites on the Game Boy Advance](./butano-multiple-sprites2.gif)

All graphics (sprites & backgrounds) for the Butano Game engine must be bitmap images. These images must be placed in the "graphics" folder of your project. No changes need to be added to the makefile. However, like mentioned in my previous tutorial on Project Structure in Butano, a matching .json file will be needed.
